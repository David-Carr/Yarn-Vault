# Yarn-Vault
This is the beginning of my first website.  I'd eventually like to create the back end so the site can be used as a personal site to keep track of someone's collection of yarns.  Most of the site was created with Bootstrap.  The CSS file and JS file is just to show I know how to link it to the HTML. I'd also like to create a lightbox gallery for finished knitted projects to display in the main image.  
Thanks for visting!
